----
The OWASP SecureTea Project is an application designed to help secure a person's laptop or computer / server with IoT (Internet Of Things) and notify users (via various communication mechanisms), whenever someone accesses their computer / server. This application uses the touchpad/mouse/wireless mouse to determine activity and is developed in Python and tested on various machines (Linux, Mac & Windows).<br>
The software is still under development, and will eventually have it's own IDS(Intrusion Detection System) / IPS(Instrusion Prevention System), firewall, anti-virus, intelligent log monitoring capabilities with web defacement detection, and support for much more communication medium.
